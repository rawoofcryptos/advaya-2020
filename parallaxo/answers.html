                <ul>
                    <li>First Round : Changing the saturation (and hue,which was actually not necessary) , revealed a text at the upper left corner. The text was "ikkudi", which was indeed the password to thhe next round.<br>Around 130 players actually cracked the first round. More players came in with the correct answer but they were already late. Came back next time!<br><br></li>
                    <li>Second Round : Changing the saturation and hue revealed two texts. One was a URL and another was just plain text. The plain text was actually a password, which was needed to unlock the file when the player opened the URL. The file which the player unclocked contained an image, which was the logo of Advaya.<br>The image, when opened in any code editor(eg:Notepad,VS Code etc), revealed the following text in the last line - "welovegeci8ch",which was the code to the Third round.<br>Only 7 players cracked this code.<br><br></li>
                    <li>Third Round : The image had the word "corner" in the middle of it. Assessing the corners of the image, and by slight changes in saturation and hue, the following texts were seen - "CTRL","SHFT","I". Pressing these in the keyboard together reveals the source code of the wepage. In the main html page, there were contained two comments. A URL and a text "no pword just blank". Opening the URL goes to file downloader and a password is asked. The password is not blank but the text "no pword just blank". The file is "feb14.png" , and right off the back, you can see that the file is corrupted. Looking closely, we can see the top few lines of the image, implying that the code is corrupted in the toppest part. Opening the png in a code editor, we can see the file has over 2000 lines. Here is the tricky hint. The file has the name "feb14", which corresponds to 02/14. Checking the line 214 of the png shows us the corrupted sentence. An extra sentence-"quarter(almost) of rotten tomatoes along with hitman". Deleting this sentence gives us the whole image.<br>The image is a guitarist playing guitar(obviously,duh), with the number 64 writtenin the bottom right corner. Well actually its a bassist, reading with your crypto mind, it actually means Base64. This will come to your mind much faster , when you check the last line of the png code which has the code "N.z.Y.z.Y.G.N.c.R.0.A./.Z.W.8.4.d.D.Q.6". Removin the dots we get NzYzYGNcR0A/ZW84dDQ6. Running it in a base64 decoder, we get the following text "763`c\G@?eo8t4:" which is yet some other kind of code. Now remember the sentence we deleted earlier?<br>
                    "quarter(almost) of rotten tomatoes along with hitman". Literally taking the meaning, quarter of rotten tomatoes is "rott" along with hitman. Now knowing 763`c\G@?eo8t4: is some kind of cryptocode, there is actualyy cryptocode known as rot 13, rot18 etc. So which rot is it? There comes hitman, also knows as agent 47. So, guessing it is ROT47,unning "763`c\G@?eo8t4:" in a rot47 decoder, reveals the code -"feb14-von6@gEci", which was the password.<br>No one was able to crack the Third Round, and we know it was difficult. We know the round included wild guesses and as a result this round involved lots of trial and errors, many came close as the base64 code, but no one passed it<br><br></li>

                Thanks to everyone who played Parallaxo. This was a crypto treasure hunt, so we know most of you couldn't participate in this.Hopefully next year, we'll take a different approach on this so many more of you can participate. Thank you from TEAM PARALLAXO!
